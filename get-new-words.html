 let's talk about the law of demeter is a design rule that tries to help you reduce coupling in
 your systems remember object orientation 101 bad cohesion good how much certain pieces
 belong together and they make sense inter twinkling intermingling two
 pieces each other making them difficult separate from so again the
 principle minimize in what does law
 say says it's okay call dot b but not to
 c do we mean with all these random letters right assume you're method access something that's scope ie also public member on so
 being context take then it or
 more generally go far not
 further can't beyond see reason for this coupling
 because are doing fact has whole chain instead just or course getting super confusing
 an actual example consider silly have
 ocean have class fish ocean
 put some collection method
 returns boolean true false dependent whether hungry that
 now whoever program think hierarchy bunch instances fish
 meant called determines particular requirement want even
 program's perspective gather out fishes actually concretely we
 filter
 would without thinking probably ok instance right
 plural as get maybe use filter function run give as
 essence us only what's problem breaking could be dinner i'm actually
 sure wording who cares generalize back is
 essentially we're when performing calling but
 slight nuances collections filters etc of
 don't should create kind facade adapter delegates b
 thing correspondingly why c
 case scenario idea words grabbing explore acting just
 like when
 one itself responsible determining which returning those and
 simply were ramp up another will object
 even worse two chains than between objects identify such realize way rid by creating usually exposing if it
 very information hiding details outside necessarily caring i'll stop rambling eh it's
